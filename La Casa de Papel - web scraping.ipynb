      "In the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo,\" a man called \"the Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the Professor, artfully guides a group of robbers: Tokyo, Rio, Berlin, Nairobi, Denver, Moscow, Oslo, and Helsinki to invade the Royal Mint of Spain in red jumpsuits and Salvador Dalí masks and take hold of 67 hostages, as part of their plan to print and escape with €2.4 billion. The police investigator Raquel Murillo is put in charge of the case, but she is unaware that the mastermind behind the heist is closer than she could ever have imagined.\n",
      "22\"Imprudencias letales\"\"Lethal Negligence\"Miguel Ángel VivasÁlex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal & David Barrocal9 May 2017 (2017-05-09)3.04[11]\n",
      "The robbers begin to print the money while Arturo Román, one of the hostages, starts making escape plans, assisted by his secretary and mistress Mónica Gaztambide, who is pregnant with his child. She is caught with a concealed cell phone and Berlin orders Denver to kill her. Meanwhile, Rio makes a mistake that leads to his and Tokyo's identities being discovered by the police.\n",

      "Believing that Denver executed Mónica under Berlin's orders, Moscow, Denver's father, is devastated and attempts to turn himself in but is dissuaded by his son. In the meantime, Raquel's relationship with her new friend Salva becomes more intimate, totally oblivious to the fact that it is a pseudonym assumed by the Professor.\n",

      "Raquel sends her police partner Ángel Rubio into the Mint undercover with a medical team that is allowed to treat Arturo, who was mistakenly shot by the police. However, the Professor sees through her move and inserts a bug in  Ángel's glasses.\n",

      "The Professor runs ahead of the police to get rid of an important piece of evidence that can endanger his plans, their fingerprints in a car at a scrap yard that Helsinki neglected to destroy. Meanwhile, Denver treats Mónica in a secret location after he shot her leg to fake her execution, and they end up becoming closer.\n",

      "As the Professor rushes out of the scrap yard, a man sees him. The Professor threatens to kill the man's family if the facial composite of his description looks like him. Berlin discovers that Denver did not kill Mónica as ordered and believing that his identity was exposed because of him, comes close to executing him for his disobedience.\n",

      "The robbers initiate a plan to use the hostages to stall the police and gain more time, but Raquel takes the chance to reveal a secret that Berlin has kept from the others—he only has a few months left to live due to a terminal illness. She also makes an attempt to convince Rio to surrender.\n",

      "Raquel loses her trust in Ángel, who is unaware of the bug the robbers planted in his glasses. Arturo prepares another plan to escape, but becomes devastated upon discovering Mónica and Denver's affair. Ángel, who is taken off the case, is in a coma after a car accident while drunk. He had discovered the Professor's identity through fingerprints taken from his cider factory, a front for his hideout.\n",
      "99\"El que la sigue la consigue\"\"Whoever Keeps Trying It, Gets It\"Jesús ColmenarÁlex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal & Esther Morales27 June 2017 (2017-06-27)2.19[11]\n",
      "Thanks to Arturo's plan, 16 hostages manage to escape, seriously injuring Oslo in the process. Before his car accident, Ángel had left a voice message on Raquel's landline explaining that Salva was the one behind the heist. Raquel's mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, listens to Ángel's message, writes it down, and tries calling Raquel's phone. When Raquel does not answer, she calls Salva for him to pass along the message. The Professor believes he has no choice but to kill Raquel's mother. He goes to her home and poisons her coffee, but cannot go through with it and slaps the cup out of her hand. When she thinks it was her fault, he realizes that she has Alzheimer's disease and simply deletes the message and takes her note. Later, Raquel brings Salva along to Toledo and finds the robbers' villa, where they planned the heist.\n",

      "A team of police are brought to the discovered villa and search through \"evidence\" planted by the Professor earlier. Raquel's ex-husband Alberto is called in to lead the forensics examination, and finds burned evidence about the Professor in the chimney. Salva rides back to Madrid with Alberto and provokes him into a fight, knocking him out and erasing the evidence. When Alberto awakes, he arrests the Professor and brings him to jail. The Professor uses the bathroom at the prison and beats himself up to make it look like Alberto was the aggressor. He calls Raquel, who helps release him. Meanwhile, the robbers start losing hope after many hours without news from the Professor, and Tokyo begins a mutiny after becoming restless.\n",
      "1111\"La cabeza del plan\"\"The Head of the Plan\"Alejandro BazzanoÁlex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal, Esther Morales & David Barrocal23 October 2017 (2017-10-23)1.73[11]\n",
      "Berlin exacts revenge on Tokyo for her mutiny, in which she played Russian roulette with him — he ties her to a table and rolls her out the front door to the police. Rio wants revenge. Tokyo fakes an injury to buy time, the Professor's number one rule after being captured. During interrogation, she comes face to face with Raquel, who wants the answer to one burning question, “Who is the Professor?”\n",
      "1212\"Cuestión de eficacia\"\"A Matter of Efficiency\"Javier QuintasÁlex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal, Esther Morales & David Barrocal2 November 2017 (2017-11-02)1.57[11]\n",
      "By the Professor's promise that he will free Tokyo from the police, Rio rejoins the robbers and helps them stop Arturo's latest escape plan. Meanwhile, Raquel sets a trap for the Professor by creating a hoax that Ángel has awakened from his coma, in hopes it will lure him to the hospital to finish him off before he can identify the Professor. The Professor, skeptical of the announcement, posts a fake casting call for clowns at the hospital and dresses up like one, blending in with the crowd while confirming the hoax. Later, while Salva meets with Raquel at a cafe, she sees an orange hair from his clown wig on his jacket. She finally realises that Salva is the Professor.\n",
      "1313\"¿Qué hemos hecho?\"\"What Have We Done?\"Jesús Colmenar & Alex RodrigoÁlex Pina, Esther Martínez Lobato, Javier Gómez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancristóbal & David Barrocal9 November 2017 (2017-11-09)1.53[11]\n",
      "Raquel takes the Professor into custody and interrogates him at the villa. The Professor admits that he has fallen in love with her, and she performs a polygraph test on him. Meanwhile, Arturo is punished for his multiple attempts to escape and Moscow reveals a secret to Denver: Moscow left his wife and Denver's mother when he was young because she was a drug addict. Denver is outraged and says he will cut Moscow out of his life. While Tokyo is transported to prison, she is freed by mercenaries sent by the Professor. She rides a motorcycle directly into the Mint, avoiding being shot by police as Moscow opens the door.\n",

      "Moscow is gravely injured by police gunfire and the police refuse to send aid. The robbers rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of the villa held at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping. Colonel Prieto, Suárez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), with whom they believe Raquel is co-operating. With her gun and badge taken away, she steals Ángel's badge and starts to conduct her own investigation by looking through surveillance footage of restaurants to determine the route the Professor took from his hideout. As she leaves, Ángel awakens.\n",

      "The police, led by Suárez, launch an attack on the Mint to liberate the hostages and capture the robbers. The robbers rush to escape with the €984 million they printed, less than half of their estimate. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits Ángel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would cause her to lose custody of her daughter, she relents. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, until he is shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of Mónica, escape to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to find it empty. One year later, Raquel has left the force and the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown. When Raquel notices coordinates on a postcard previously given to her by the Professor, she tracks him down in Palawan, Philippines.\n",

      "Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists.\" Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to Guna Yala, Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to La Pampa, Argentina, and Denver, Mónica and her baby to Java, Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the black market in Casablanca from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by Europol. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio. The professor enlists three new members, Bogotá, Palermo and Marseille, into the gang and begins planning an assault on the Bank of Spain, from an Italian monastery.\n",

      "The Professor initiates the plan to rob the Bank of Spain using airships to release money across Madrid. The government responds by mobilizing the army, which the robbers use to provide cover and entry into the Bank. In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Martín, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andrés). The Professor and Martín (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on Aikido, a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage. As the robbers enter the Bank, public sentiment rallies to their side in the form of mass government protests and riots over the illegal imprisonment of Rio, demanding that he receive a public trial.\n",

      "While commandeering the Bank, the robbers engage in a series of intense conflicts with guards and government officials. Palermo, the commander in charge, is temporarily blinded in the struggle, but retains command after Nairobi removes glass shrapnel from his eyes, and the guards restrained. The robbers locate accomplices among the hostages who were previously planted in the Bank and go to work on opening the vault, which is rigged to flood with water once tampered with. Bogotá, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold. In flashbacks, Andrés and Martín explain the plan for breaking into the vault, explaining that every step of the plan requires 100 percent commitment and perfection to work, leaving no room for error.\n",

      "The crew begins the next phase of the robbery while the Professor addresses the new government officials from the intelligence directorate. Colonel Tamayo and Alicia Sierra prove to be formidable adversaries, as they quickly realize that they must change their strategies drastically from the first robbery. Sierra tortures Rio for more information and Tamayo plans an assault on the bank with Suárez. The robbers reveal that they know about a second, secret vault behind the gold and attempt to persuade the governor of the bank to open it for them. When he refuses, Denver hits him, triggering a seizure; they resuscitate him and use explosives instead.\n",
      "205\"Las cajas rojas\"\"The Red Boxes\"Koldo SerraJavier Gómez Santander, Álex Pina, Juan Salvador López, Luis Moya19 July 2019 (2019-07-19)\n",
      "A love interest between Palermo and Helsinki is revealed. Given no other option, the robbers detonate the inner vault door inside the flooded main chamber. It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"—cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage—an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting. Inside the bank, the team divides when Nairobi and Palermo disagree over the use of force on the unruly restrained guards. Nairobi reveals her love for Helsinki and berates Palermo for not acting on his feelings for Berlin when he was alive.\n",

      "In flashbacks, the Professor discusses the plans for the bank with Martín, Andrés, and Andrés' love interest, Tatiana, where he is immediately alarmed at how much she knows. Andrés defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Suárez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their RV sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"Bella ciao\" on video. Given no other option, Tamayo and Sierra agree to release Rio in exchange for the breaching team and 40 hostages.\n",

      "Sierra prepares Rio for release at a military hospital. At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dalí masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation,\" the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a drone, forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes refuge in a barn.\n",

      "Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-stupor as a result of her breakup and insults Rio. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a Mexican Standoff. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a mule, as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an armoured car. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an exsanguinating Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Suárez and the Civil Guard find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares DEFCON 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with RPG-7s. Afterwards, it is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Suárez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n",

      "The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a coup d'état, and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi. In flashbacks, Nairobi convinces Tokyo that she ask the Professor to be the leader of the heist, but the Professor insists that since Palermo came up with the idea for the heist, he will be in charge.\n",

      "Tokyo ultimately leads the successful surgery of Nairobi, removing the bullet by cutting out a portion of her lung. With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogotá and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Antoñanzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below. Sierra tells Lisbon that if she cooperates, her probable 30 year sentence would potentially be reduced to 10 years, and that she would be out in five years.\n",
      "2611\"Lección de anatomía\"\"Anatomy Lesson\"Álex RodrigoAna Boyero, Jaun Salvador López3 April 2020 (2020-04-03)\n",
      "The Professor and Marseille help Antoñanzas out of the pool, and persuade him to do tasks for them by offering him €1 million. They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Antoñanzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to Mindanao, Philippines—where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Antoñanzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gandía, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gandía dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gandía from escaping. Meanwhile, Nairobi becomes conscious.\n",

      "The gang rush to find Gandía. Gandía has already found Nairobi and attempts to suffocate her with a pillow, but she is able to stab him in the neck with a needle; he flees as the gang rush to Nairobi. Gandía later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogotá and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gandía retreats to a secret panic room, he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gandía uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Antoñanzas tells the Professor that Gandía is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gandía knocks her out from behind.\n",

      "In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gandía restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a trans woman that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gandía said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the foundry—43.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogotá and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gandía throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gandía and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gandía escapes through a duct. The duct leads him to the room Nairobi is in, and he headlocks her.\n",

      "The gang hears Nairobi's gun fire, and they rush to her. Gandía shoots a hole through the door and forces her head through it while he ties her hands to the door. In flashbacks, Nairobi asks the Professor to be the father of her child by in vitro fertilisation because she believes the Professor to have good genes. Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office—behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Suárez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel. Gandía unties Nairobi and uses her to escape while the group holds him at gunpoint. As he escapes, he shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly—Denver throws a grenade, which injures Gandía.\n",

      "A wounded Gandía makes it back to the panic room. The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom. Tamayo calls Gandía's communications centre, but the telecommunication cords are cut by Bogotá before he can answer. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjamín, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gandía unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank. The Ministry of the Interior takes over Lisbon's custody, and removes her from the tent.\n",
      "3116\"Plan París\"\"The Paris Plan\"Jesús ColmenarAna Boyero, Emilio Díez, Luis Moya, Jaun Salvador López3 April 2020 (2020-04-03)\n",
      "In flashbacks, Berlin confronts Palermo about his feelings towards him, while also revealing his own feelings for Palermo. They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjamín and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Antoñanzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Antoñanzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjamín and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gandía to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gandía is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n",
